 My CSV separator

Read data from an input CSV file named ```"school.csv,"``` remove double quotation marks from each value in the rows, then split the data into numerous output CSV files with a maximum of ```400 rows``` each.
The output file names are in the format ```"school_{page_count}.csv"```, where {page_count} represents the page number.
